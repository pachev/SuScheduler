## Testing

To run tests you will need to install (through npm):
* karma
* karma-cli
* karma-jasmine
* angular-mocks
* phantomjs

it's best to install all at the same time and with `--save-dev` flag. Also, to
avoid any errors you should instlal the same version of angular-mocks as the 
angular version currently being used by ionic.
